Packages to install:

1) npm i react-router-dom   //it is used for routing setup at backend side
2) npm i express  // framework that will help us to build this system
3) npm i dotenv  // dotenv is a module in Node.js that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. This is particularly useful in a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application for several reasons:
4) mongoose // It is database used for the data saving
5) cors    //CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): In a MERN stack application, you might use the cors middleware to enable CORS. This allows your Express.js server to accept requests from different origins, meaning your React.js frontend (which is served on a different port in development) can successfully make requests to your Express.js backend
6) validator // it is used to apply the validation on form input fields
